# 8-Queens-Puzzle

C++ Program that allows users to place or remove 8 chess queens on a 8x8 chess board until no two queens threaten each other.

-Uses a backtracking algorithm to determine if a Queen placement is valid, so that no two queens arae threatening each other.

-Keeps a count of the number of valid queens placed to determine if 8 valid queens have been placed.

-Makes use of pointer manipulation to visualize the board layout.

-Developed the ability to reset the board entirely, or to delete a specific queen based on the user inputted coordinates.
